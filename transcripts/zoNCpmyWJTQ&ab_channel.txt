hello everyone welcome to this session on Zord data engineer certification this is dong on this site and today in this session I'm going to guide you on how to become a certified assort data engineer and we're going to discuss the dp23 aort data engineer certification now let's go ahead and get started with the agenda to understand what all will be covering in this session so guys we're going to start this session by first understanding who is a data engineer exactly once we're done with that we'll move on and understand what are the Azor data engineer salaries especially when you're aiming to become an Azor data engineer and then understand the things need to learn in order to correct the aor data engineer certification which we're going to discuss in details finally we're going to discuss how we can get started with all these things that we're going to discuss in this session and become a certified aor data engineer all right right guys so this is the agenda for today's session I hope it's clear to you now let's go ahead and start off with the first topic which is who is an aor data engineer and what does she do so an aor data engineer is a professional who specialize in the design development and maintainance of data infrastructure the main focus is to ensure that data can be stored processed and analyzed effectively and efficiently now in today's world where data is playing an increasing important role in decision making the role of a data in engineer is becoming more crucial now a data engineer primary responsibility includes designing and implementing data storage system data processing pipelines and data analysis tools now they work closely with data scientists and analysts to understand the data needs of an organization and to ensure that the data infrastructure can support these needs they are responsible for ensuring data infrastructure is scalable secure and reliable now one of the key tasks of a data engineer is to design and Implement data storage system this involves choosing the right data storage technology such as database or cloud storage solutions and ensuring that data can be stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and Analysis the data engineer must also take into account the size and complexity of the data as well as the data access pattern to ensure that the data storage systems can handle the volume of data and the number of users another important aspect of a data engineer role is the design and implementation of data process accessing pipelines this involve taking raw data and transforming it into a format that can be easily analyzed now data engineer must have a strong understanding of data processing technology such as Hadoop or Apache spark to implement these pipeline they must also be familiar with the different data formats and data structures such as the structured and semi-structured and unstructured data to ensure that the data can be processed accurately and efficiently now in addition to designing and implementing data stor storage and processing system data engineer also play an important role in development of data analysis tools they work closely with data scientists and analysts to understand the requirements and to develop tools that can help them analyze the data effectively but these tools can include dashboards reports and machine learning models so data security is another important aspects of a data engineer role they must ensure that the data is secure and protected from an unauthorized access have or loss so this involve implementing data encryption firewalls and other security measures to protect the data they must also ensure that the data is stored and processed in compliance with privacy and data protection laws a data engineer must also be knowledgeable about cloud computing and its various services such as Amazon web services Microsoft aor and Google Cloud now cloud computing is becoming increasingly popular as a way to store and process large amount of data and data engineer must be able to design and Implement data storage and processing system that take advantage of these Services finally data engineer must have a strong problem solving skills and to be able to work Under Pressure they must be able to troubleshoot problems with the data infrastructure and identify and fix any issues that arise now they must also be able to work collaboratively with other team members such as a data scientist and analyst to ensure that the data infrastructure support the data need of the organization in conclusion the role of a data engineer is crucial in today's data driven World they are responsible for Designing and implementing the infrastructure that enables organization to store process and analyze data effectively and efficiently they must have a strong understanding of data storage data processing and data analyst technology as well as the ability to work collaboratively with other teams to support the data needs of the organization now after this I think you guys now have an idea about what data engineer will do in his day-to-day life right now let's move on and talk about what are the salaries of an aor data engineer so let's go ahead and also understand the average salary of a data engineer so in the US the average salary of a data engineer is $133,000 but remember guys this is basically an average salary so it can either be higher or lower than this amount in India the salary is around 6.5 lakh perom and the same goes for the Indian jobs as well that is salary can be higher than this average package as well and now a lot higher actually and can be lower than this package as well moving forward now that we are clear with who and what are the salary of an aor data engineer we shall understand the things that you need to know about the certification so if you are applying for an Azor data engineer associate there used to be two exams that you have to give one is implementing an aor data solution and the next exam is design and aor data solution after clearing both these exams it will give you the aor data engineer associate certification and these two exam basically have the code dp200 and DP 2011 right but now this exam have retired on February 23rd 2021 you guys can give just one exam to clear the data engineer certification and this exam is dp23 so what they've done is they have claped both these exam and they have now included its cabus in just one exam and they're asking questions from it right so earlier you had to pay for two exam prepare for two exam and give them and then only you could get the certification but now just by passing one exam you can clear out the data engineer certification right now as part of the new exam the skill set has now been updated right so basically these are the distribution of topics of how they will be covered in the exams the questions right first of all you will be asked most of the questions on design and Implement data storage now this is going to have 40 to 45% weightage now there are some of the topics that fall under this category that is design a data storage structure design a partitioning strategy design the serving layers Implement physical data storage structures Implement logical data structures and implement the serving layer after this you will have design and develop data processing which is of 25 to 30% of weightage so you'll have inj and transform data you'll have questions on design and develop a patch processing solution then you'll have question on on design and develop a stream processing solution and manage batches and pipeline right now after this we have to design and Implement data security which is of 10 to 15% weightage now the question which comes on this topics Falls as design security for data policies and standards then Implement data security and lastly you have Monitor and optimize data storage and data processing which is again 10 to 15% of weightage now the question that fall under this category is Monitor data storage and data processing and optimize and troubleshoot data storage and data processing now if you are with me till at this point you will have understood what are all the things that you have to learn in order to clear exam and become an aor data engineer right so like I said earlier you now just have to give this dp23 exam to get the Microsoft certified associate data engineer certification okay so just one exam and now you'll get the certification for it now let's move on guys and now let's talk about how you guys can get started in clearing this exam right so we have mentioned a lot of things that you have to learn but how exactly should you go forward and start learning these things now let's go ahead and clear that out so first of all guys what you can do or what we can do for you is you can basically refer to a lot of blogs that we have written on or we frequently update videos on YouTube as well such as this video which has info about the engineering certification you can also go ahead and check out a video which I have mentioned earlier on how to become an aor data engineer which is there at the description box below we frequently put out more videos for such topics now you can go through them and basically get a jump start into how you can prepare right now my recommendation to you will be to plan out your working plan ask after or before working shf of yours you should spend at least three or 4 hours every day for the next two or 3 months in order to clear this certification exam otherwise if you don't invest this much amount of time guys it is going to be difficult to crack this exam because there are a lot of things to learn and especially if you're not from a data engineering domain it's going to be a little difficult because you'll have to read documentation you'll have to do Hands-On right you will get stuck I know that but being stuck is the most beautiful part of learning anything because that is when you start the actual research and know more about things right so spend at least two to three hours every day either after your workshift or before your workshift to basically learn this technology right and now for those people who feel that they do not have a time or they do not want to invest time in researching and they want someone to help them out in getting this exam cleared guys we at Eda also offer a course on Microsoft aor certification training or the Azor data engineer associate certification course we also have a master program as well which is basically help you in clearing the aor data engineer associate certification so if you need a helping hand and you need someone or you need to be taught by someone who's already cleared this examination and is already working as a data engineer in the industry then this is the right course for you so with this guys I would like to take a leave from you all if you have any doubts related to the topic or certification you can always contact us or comment them down in the comment section below all right so thank you guys for joining in have a great day ahead and happy learning e
